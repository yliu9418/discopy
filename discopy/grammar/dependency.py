"""
Interface from spacy to discopy to create diagrams from a document.

Before using the interface, download a language model appropriate for
the task, see https://spacy.io/usage/models

In short, download the language model you would like::
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Then load it within python as follows::
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.")

or::
    python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm
::
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp("Le renard brun et agile a sauté par dessus le chien parasseux.")

    Given a spaCy token, recursively builds a dependency diagram from its

    tree ('ROOT' if the token is the head of the tree).

    Given a parsing of some text (a list of spaCy tokens with punctuation removed), uses
